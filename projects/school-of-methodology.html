            <p>The School of Methodology reimagines education as a process of discovery through making. Housed in a converted industrial building, the school organizes learning around workshops, studios, and shared production spaces rather than traditional classrooms.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="image-text">
                <p>The existing industrial structure is carved open to create a central courtyard—a gathering space that brings light deep into the building while providing an outdoor room for exhibitions, performances, and informal learning. This courtyard becomes the social heart of the school, visible from all levels.</p>

            <div class="image-text">
                <p>The adaptive reuse strategy preserves the industrial character of the existing structure—exposed steel, concrete floors, generous ceiling heights—while inserting new elements that support the school's pedagogical approach. Mezzanines, catwalks, and movable partitions allow spaces to be reconfigured as projects evolve.</p>

            <div class="image-text">
                <p>The section reveals how different scales of making are accommodated vertically: heavy workshop equipment on the ground floor, lighter studios and seminar rooms above, and a rooftop greenhouse for material experiments. A continuous stair and ramp system encourages movement and chance encounters between disciplines.</p>

                <p>New insertions are detailed to read as distinct from the existing structure—lighter, more refined, clearly contemporary. This dialogue between old and new reinforces the school's philosophy: that making something new requires understanding what came before.</p>
